# Hey Welcome To The Coding Interview Preparation Guide

Welcome to the **Coding Interview: Preparation Guide**! This site is designed to help you prepare for technical interviews with a focus on Python, SQL, and key discussion topics.

## Introduction

This guide is based on the book **"Cracking the Coding Interview"** by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, which is widely regarded as a must-read for anyone preparing for technical interviews. The goal of this repository is to provide a structured approach to practice and discussion, enabling you to confidently tackle coding challenges and system design questions.

### 1. Python Practice

This section contains Python coding exercises that cover a range of topics commonly asked in technical interviews, such as:

- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, etc.)
- Problem Solving (String manipulation, Number theory, Bit manipulation, etc.)

Each exercise comes with a problem statement, example input/output, and a solution for reference.

I would like to extend a special thanks to [Abdullah Al Masud Tushar](https://github.com/darkprinx) for his invaluable contributions For This Python Section.

### 2. SQL Practice

This section provides SQL exercises to help you practice database-related interview questions, including:

- Basic to Advanced SQL queries
- Joins, Subqueries, and CTEs
- Aggregations and Window Functions
- Database Design and Normalization

Each SQL problem is designed to test your knowledge of database concepts and your ability to write efficient queries.

### 3. Discussion Topics

This section includes discussion topics and questions to deepen your understanding of:

- System Design (Scalability, Load Balancing, Caching, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Design Principles
- Best Practices in Software Development
- Behavioral Interview Questions and Strategies

These topics are aimed at preparing you for the non-coding aspects of technical interviews, such as discussing your approach, explaining trade-offs, and demonstrating clear communication.
